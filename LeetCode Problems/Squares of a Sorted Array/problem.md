# Squares of a Sorted Array

**Link to Problem:** https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/

**Description:**

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Examples:**

- Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

- Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.z
